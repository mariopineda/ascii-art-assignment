# processing-console-1-ascii-art

**[Assignment Standard Operating Procedures](https://mariopineda.github.io/assignment-sops/)**

In this assignment you will be using println to create formatted console output, including ASCII art.

## Set up

1. If you have not yet installed Processing on your Raspberry Pi you can do so by running the following command in the terminal:  ```wget https://processing.org/download/install-arm.sh && sudo sh install-arm.sh```
2. To launch processing run the following set of commands in the terminal:
```
cd /usr/local/bin
./processing &
```
3. Fork the assignment (using the fork button in GitHub). 
4. Clone the assigment to your Raspberry Pi (```git clone git://github.com/mariopineda/ascii-art-assignment.git ```).
5. Navigate to the cloned repository (```cd ascii-art-assignment```) and launch processing.
6. In the Processing IDE, create and save an empty file for your code called ``ascii-art-assignment``.
7. Commit!
8. Add the program skeleton. If you are using Processing the skelton code is:

```
/**
 * <program/assignment name>
 * by <Your Name>
 * 
 * <Two sentence description of program>
 * 
 */
 
void setup() {
  
}

void draw() {

}
```
9. Commit!

## Part 1
Using the ```print``` (reference for ```print```: https://processing.org/reference/print_.html) and ``println`` (reference for ```println```: https://processing.org/reference/println_.html) constructs write code that console prints the first six letters of your first and/or last names so that it looks like the following example.  When running your program the letters must line up properly.

### Remember!
Commit and push/sync after adding/revising each new functional code chunk. Test run your program before each commit to make sure it runs and behaves the way it is supposed to.

### Tip
To: Using escape characters is not required but may help you

\‚Äù - to print a quotation mark

\n - to create a new line

\t - to tab 3 spaces

\\\ - to print a backslash - this is needed for some ASCII art

## Part 2
What is ASCII art? ASCII is the set of symbols (letters, punctuation marks and numbers) that make up the English language.  In the computer world, each of these ASCII symbols is assigned a number so that we can tell the computer what to print in binary.  For example: the capital letter P is represented by the number 80 which is 01010000 in binary. You do not need to know about binary or how ASCII works,... yet.  

Go to the site http://www.chris.com/ascii/ and look at some of the examples of ASCII art.  Then, write code to print a simple work of ASCII art. You can find one and copy it or make it up on your own. Your art should take between 10-15 and lines of code.  The code from Part 2 should be appended to the code file from Part 1.
